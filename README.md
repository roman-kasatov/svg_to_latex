# svg_to_latex

The utility allows you to convert an __svg__ file with a simple vector image into a set of LaTex format formulas. Next they could be used for example in Demos.

### What it can
Now only several type of figures are supported:
- line 
- rect
- circle
- ellipse

`Note: sometimes rect works incorrectly`

### How to use
1. Set up __filename__ and __precision__ in .py file. It's a name of .svg file `(like 'aesc.svg')` and number of decimal places in result formulas
2. Place .svg file to the folder with svg_to_latex.py
3. Run the script with __python svg_to_latex.py__
